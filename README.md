### Winstrumenta - A collection of tools for WSL & WSA

The `Winstrumenta` toolset focuses on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Android (WSA). The goal is to make the life of developers and users easier by providing quality of life tools for every day use cases.

The main tool right now is `Package Manager`.

`Package Manager` is graphical use interface for managing `deb`, `rpm` and `apk` packages. It integrates into seamlessy in the windows explorer.

- `deb`, `rpm` and `apk` (on WSA, emulators and physical devices) packages are supported

- Easy selection of target distribution (if there are multiple ones)

- Uses native package managers of the selected distribution for compability

- Easy up- or downgrade of packages

## Getting started with `Package Manager`

Package Manager is distributed through the `Microsoft Store`:

</a>

Please note that `WSL 2` needs to be activated and running. Managing apps in WSL 1 should work but hasn't been tested.

## Roadmap

- Support dependencies: Currently `dpkg` and `rpm` are used to install packages. Both doesn't support dependency resolution.

- Support more package formats:

  - Alpine packages (`apk`)

  - Arch packages (`ar`)

- Advanced package management:

  - Extract/View instead of install or uninstall
