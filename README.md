### Winstrumenta - A collection of tools for WSL & WSA

The `Winstrumenta` toolset focuses on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Android (WSA). The goal is to make the life of developers and users easier by providing quality of life tools for every day use cases.

The main tool right now is `Package Manager`.

`Package Manager` is graphical use interface for managing `deb` and `rpm` packages. It integrates into seamlessy in the windows explorer.

- Both `deb` and `rpm` packages are supported

- Easy selection of target distribution (if there are multiple)

- Uses native package managers of the selected distribution for compability

- Easy up- or downgrade of packages

## Getting started with `Package Manager`

Package Manager is distributed through the `Microsoft Store`:

Please note that `WSL 2` needs to be activated and running. WSL 1 should be working but hasn't been tested.

## Roadmap

* Support dependencies: Currently `dpkg` and `rpm` are used to install packages. Both doesn't support dependency resolution.

* Support more package formats:
  
  * Alpine packages (`apk`)
  
  * Android packages (`apk`) for physical devices and emulators (including WSA)
  
  * Arch packages (`ar`)

* Advanced package management:
  
  * Easy uninstallation
  
  * Extract/View instead of install or uninstall
